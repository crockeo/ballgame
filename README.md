# BallGame

### Description
---

A computerized version of French Solitaire Checkers (as according to the game)
box itself.

The controls are a little awkward at this time, but I plan to fix them up and
maybe make a full gui so the game is click-and-drag rather than typing in
commands.

It was also intended to be used to devise a solution to the problem itself,
which is still my ultimate goal.
